# SGLang Deployment Comparison

This document compares SGLang deployment with other inference solutions in the awsome-inference repository.

## Deployment Approaches

| Feature | SGLang (CDK) | NIMs (EKS/EC2) | TRT-LLM (EKS) | Ray Service (EKS) |
|---------|--------------|----------------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Deployment Method** | AWS CDK | Kubernetes/EC2/SageMaker | Kubernetes | Kubernetes |
| **Scaling** | EC2 Auto Scaling Groups | K8s HPA/Cluster Autoscaler | K8s HPA | Ray Autoscaling |
| **Pre-built Models** | AMI with models | Container images | Container images | Container images |
| **Load Balancing** | Custom router on EC2 | K8s Service/ALB | K8s Service | Ray Serve |
| **GPU Support** | G4dn, G5, G6, P4d, P5 | All GPU instances | P5 focused | All GPU instances |
| **Startup Time** | Fast (pre-built AMIs) | Moderate | Moderate | Moderate |

## When to Use SGLang

Choose SGLang deployment when you need:

1. **Rapid Scaling**: Pre-built AMIs with models enable 5-10x faster scaling than container-based solutions
2. **Cost Optimization**: Warm pools and efficient auto-scaling reduce idle resource costs
3. **Simple Operations**: No Kubernetes expertise required - pure AWS services
4. **High Throughput**: Optimized for serving many concurrent requests
5. **Quantization Support**: Native support for AWQ, AWQ-Marlin, FP8 quantization methods

## When to Use Alternatives

- **NIMs**: When you need NVIDIA's optimized inference containers and enterprise support
- **TRT-LLM on EKS**: When you need maximum performance optimization and have Kubernetes expertise
- **Ray Service**: When serving multiple model types or need Ray's distributed computing features

## Performance Characteristics

- **SGLang**: Best for high-throughput, latency-tolerant workloads
- **TRT-LLM**: Best for lowest latency requirements
- **NIMs**: Best balance of ease-of-use and performance
- **Ray**: Best for heterogeneous model serving

## Integration with AWS Services

All solutions integrate well with AWS services, but SGLang's CDK approach provides:
- Native CloudWatch integration
- Direct EC2 Auto Scaling
- Simple IAM role management
- Built-in VPC support
